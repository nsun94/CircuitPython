These are my circuit python assignments

## Hello CircuitPython

### Assignment
In this assignment I learned the basicsa of a new coding language. The Metro itself functions really similarly to an arduino. The metro has a cool little RGB LED that you can change the color of with code. The objective of this assignment was to get the built in LED to fade in and out.
